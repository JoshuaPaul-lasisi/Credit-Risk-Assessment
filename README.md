# Credit Risk Assessment Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a credit scoring model to automate the decision-making process for approving home equity lines of credit. By leveraging data from 5,960 recent loan applicants, the model predicts the likelihood of a loan default based on various financial and demographic features. The model must comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by being both empirically derived and statistically sound, with clear explanations for any adverse actions.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, handle duplicates, and ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Modeling:** Train several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict loan defaults.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrix.
- **Interpretability:** Ensure the model's decisions are interpretable to comply with legal requirements.

## Results

- **Best Performing Model:** The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy with strong interpretability.
- **Challenges and Future Work:** Imbalanced data and potential overfitting in complex models were addressed, and future work could involve hyperparameter tuning and exploring advanced techniques for better accuracy and fairness.
